# grocery-tracker
CS-210 project 3
## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

### The Grocery TRacker app was created to help Corner Grocer in analyzing and tracking their daily sales. The goal of the app is to help the store design their store layout in a more efficient way for their customers. It provides a user friendly interface to assist in their data analysis.

## What did you do particularly well?
### I think I did well with the main file. The main programs follows the app logic and flow.

## Where could you enhance your code?
###I can enhance my code by incorprotating more error or exception handling.

## How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
### Error handling will make the code better by validating user input and providing clear error messages, such as if a item is not on the file list.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
### Writing the Tracker.cpp file was the most challenging because it was harder to debug. However, the IDE I use highlights the line of code where the bug might occur.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

### An important skill I leanred was documentation and writing comments in code. I  realized the important of giving details on how the code works and teach the end user on how to use the code.
